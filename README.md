# Projects-in-Java
 this repository contains programs that I either wrote or extended as part of university projects

# Automail
The Automail project was completed using template code provided by tutors and was completed in a team environment. The focus of the subject in question was software design, so we had to plan everything through use domain models, design sequence diagrams etc. This was to ensure Object oriented design principles were followed throughout the development process and to ensure the working system was as extensible as possible for future changes. The analysis pdf can be found [here](/Automail/DesignAnalysis.pdf)

# Cribbage
Similarly, the Cribbage project was the second project for my Software Design course, where I worked in a team of 3 to develop a small card game from template code provided by tutors. Following the same development process from conception to project completion, you can find an analysis of my design choices and relevant diagrams [here](/Cribbage_Game/SWEN30006-Project-2-FINAL-Report.pdf)
